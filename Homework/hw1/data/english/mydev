i wanted to update to 12.04 and after this i reboot the system choose the new kernel
ok 1 sec
bekks, was, he said he is not running that kernel
Mulder911  type ps -e|less <-- which has number 88 ?
XiaolinDraconis, Is that what is on the usb, you want it clean to start with, no hidden trash with stuff in it either.
pepee: Then how can we investigate what is causing that error...?
I suppose it means, the PID will not necessarily be the same
bekks, reading the logs, it should say what process was this
wilee-nilee, no thats my home directory, but its not the problem as mini.iso loads just fine, i think its not mounting cause its on another partition that is mounted as well
bekks, at least that's what a bit of googling shows
on this kernel i don`t see pid88
google  "/proc/*/oom_adj is deprecated, please use /proc/*/oom_score_adj"
XiaolinDraconis, Drag it to your desktop and mount it there.
Mulder911, in a terminal, type:   grep -n "oom_adj is deprecated" /var/log/*
wilee-nilee, that was my thoughts as well
/var/log/kern.log:751:Oct 31 00:46:10 bt kernel: [    1.631658] udevd (92): /proc/92/oom_adj is deprecated, please use /proc/92/oom_score_adj instead.
wilee-nilee, that failed as well
XiaolinDraconis, I always reformat the usb as well each time to be sure it is clean, if I do a load this way.
wilee-nilee, the usb is freshly formatted
XiaolinDraconis, So what is the actual failure?
Mulder911: So which process is PID 92?
wilee-nilee, the iso wont mount
wilee-nilee, opening it with archive manager and can see the contents from there
Mulder911, in the terminal, type:   grep -n "Linux version" /var/log/kern.log
bekks, PID 92
XiaolinDraconis, Not even with a right click on it then clicking on open with archive mounter
bekks, PID 92 is udevd

wilee-nilee, thats how ive been trying to do it, atm i have it open in archive manager
XiaolinDraconis, Do you se all the files?
wilee-nilee, as far as i can tell i do, have had a problem opening any of the folders
XiaolinDraconis, If you see all the files like I posted, the the exstract should run it just takes a bit to do it I just ran it, about 8-1o min I think.
wilee-nilee, trying it again
Mulder911, try upgrating now and see it if installs a new kernel, I suppose this should solve it
so upgrade one more time
Mulder911, yes. AFAIK 3.2.6 is not the latest kernel in 12.04.1
ok
i`ll try
wilee-nilee, of course this time it finishes in 40 seconds
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
Which will not upgrade the kernel.
bekks, what's the current kernel in 12.04?
i`m upgrading with kpackagekit
pepee: No 12.04 handy here, maybe you can take alook at packages.ubuntu.com
bekks, why do you say it will not upgrade the kernel?
pepee: Because thats the truth. apt-get will keep back kernel packages. You have to update them explicitely.
XiaolinDraconis, What I have found with the W7 ISO is that it is locked unless mounted that is probably why, I'm not sure of other ways to mount it, I have been using the usb loader I posted for a coulple of years now and have not had to do it this way. I know it works though has everytime I did in the past. YOu might just install the multisystem loader and use it
wilee-nilee, i hope this works, ive got 2 hours to try and get my girls laptop back to working condition. i thought gparted was still simulating and hit cancel, man was i wrong
bekks, dist-upgrade does that for you
pepee: Yes, and we were talking about apt-get upgrade ;)
but... 3.2.6 is not from the repos, is it?
The 12.04 kernel version is 3.2.0-xyz
XiaolinDraconis, Hehe not the person to disappoint. ;)
pepee: Nope, it isnt.
bekks, I was talking about upgrade, generically. I always use dist-upgrade, so I don't know much about other package managers
wilee-nilee, yeah specially not after shes been at work most of the day while i get to sit around the house
XiaolinDraconis, hehe you are in deep dodo now. ;)
wilee-nilee, unless magic happens and the next 2 hours go flawlessly (never in my lifetime)
XiaolinDraconis, I clone all my installs, you might do this after you are setup with clonezilla.
wilee-nilee, clonezilla is what ruined my windows installation in the first place
XiaolinDraconis, If I remember you cloned it to a ext4 right?
how can i use a .htaccess for my phpmyadmin directory ?
i tried enabling override all in /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
didnt help
wilee-nilee, and then did it again (hadnt deleted the original partition yet) on a fresh ntfs partition
i tried a bunch of other stuff which didn't help
and now i kindof gave up and figured i'd ask on IRC
wilee-nilee, which is when i was told to delete the original because it kept booting that instead of the new one
firefox version 16.0.2 always ask for zip code on google shop and ebay how to save my zip ????
wilee-nilee, only to find out the new one failed to boot cause it wasnt in the same location
hi i am trying to set up a dhcpd and i have become a little lost i think i have one running but no idea which one it is and no matter what i do the windows box on the other end of the wire seems to get an ip of 192.168.0.20 how can i work out where its getting it from ?
XiaolinDraconis, I have never had clonezilla fail, but I follow some rules, I have the windows fully defragged to the front of the disc and make sure in general it is good shape by running a chkdsk every so often on it
Hi, i need a little hand to help me get back system sound on ubuntu 11.10, can anyone help me? After i tried to install google gadgets, my sound device doesnt work correctly
XiaolinDraconis, Lots of other cloners though.
wilee-nilee, as far as i know windows checks to make sure the hardware hasnt changed and when it detects a major change it requires re-activation
wilee-nilee, all my old discs ended up getting trashed when i moved
how do i make ubuntu into its own proxy
hi, i use phpmyadmin on ubuntu 12.04, and i want to use a .htaccess in my phpmyadmin dir, but it doesn't seem to work, i set AllowOverride All for the dir in /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
Why i cant access sound configuration on my Ubuntu 11.10?!?
XiaolinDraconis, That is in system changes if the update reading is really far off I have only seen that one time with a XP setup. I have W7 pro and it has unlimited images that can be made although it will overwrite the last one if saved in the same place. I don't really use windows much, but I keep it squeaky clean with bleachbit and defragging and some other apps to have it in good shape and I have no problem just throwing in a fresh install o
nce in awhile.
wilee-nilee, right but i was attempting to move it to a new hard drive, ive never been able to do that without having to use the rescue disc afterwards
anyone?
wilee-nilee, im seeing lots of topics online where several people have done it, sadly its not been my luck
XiaolinDraconis, You will need the recovery if the mbr is not saved, clonezilla saves the mbr, that is why I like it.
If the mbr has grub there though you will need to reload it if the linux install is not included.
wilee-nilee, it wasnt on the first partition, the mbr was over-written by grub.
wilee-nilee, and somehow i just ran out of space on a 4GB drive, told ya luck isnt in my bag of tricks
wilee-nilee, nautilus tells me i got 1GB left on the drive.... GRRRR
XiaolinDraconis, Did you show the hidden files and makes sure there was nothing there, if you were finally loading it with the ISO?
wilee-nilee, i was copying files from the extracted directory, one file said something about no space left on the disk, splicing error or something
wilee-nilee, im formating it to fat32 now and gonna try the multiboot tool
XiaolinDraconis, cool good luck the windows will be in the grub4 choice of the grub menu I believe, you have to look for it
any idea how to install create ubuntu on sofware raid and LVM
nobody that ever did this? :s
with that usb loader it does not just show in the main grub menu you will see. XiaolinDraconis
