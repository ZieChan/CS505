i wanted to update to 12.04 and after this i reboot the system choose the new kernel
ok 1 sec
bekks, was, he said he is not running that kernel
Mulder911  type ps -e|less <-- which has number 88 ?
XiaolinDraconis, Is that what is on the usb, you want it clean to start with, no hidden trash with stuff in it either.
pepee: Then how can we investigate what is causing that error...?
I suppose it means, the PID will not necessarily be the same
bekks, reading the logs, it should say what process was this
wilee-nilee, no thats my home directory, but its not the problem as mini.iso loads just fine, i think its not mounting cause its on another partition that is mounted as well
bekks, at least that's what a bit of googling shows
on this kernel i don`t see pid88
google  "/proc/*/oom_adj is deprecated, please use /proc/*/oom_score_adj"
XiaolinDraconis, Drag it to your desktop and mount it there.
Mulder911, in a terminal, type:   grep -n "oom_adj is deprecated" /var/log/*
wilee-nilee, that was my thoughts as well
/var/log/kern.log:751:Oct 31 00:46:10 bt kernel: [    1.631658] udevd (92): /proc/92/oom_adj is deprecated, please use /proc/92/oom_score_adj instead.
wilee-nilee, that failed as well
XiaolinDraconis, I always reformat the usb as well each time to be sure it is clean, if I do a load this way.
wilee-nilee, the usb is freshly formatted
XiaolinDraconis, So what is the actual failure?
Mulder911: So which process is PID 92?
wilee-nilee, the iso wont mount
wilee-nilee, opening it with archive manager and can see the contents from there
Mulder911, in the terminal, type:   grep -n "Linux version" /var/log/kern.log
bekks, PID 92
XiaolinDraconis, Not even with a right click on it then clicking on open with archive mounter
bekks, PID 92 is udevd
